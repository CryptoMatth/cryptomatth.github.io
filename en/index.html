            <h2>What is CryptoMatth?</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>CryptoMatth</strong>, my space dedicated to the discovery and study of mathematics and cryptography. This site was born out of a passion for two fascinating worlds and aims to collect, deepen, and share the knowledge acquired over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <em>Mathematics</em> section, you will find a complete course covering the topics addressed in the last three years of high school, integrated with an in-depth study of Calculus 1. Each topic is presented with detailed explanations and accompanied by practical exercises, designed to consolidate theory and stimulate critical thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Cryptography</em> section will guide you through the history and evolution of ciphers, treated like a real university course. Together, we will analyze the mechanisms of encryption systems, from classical methods to the most modern techniques, always accompanied by examples and problems to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you are a student looking for in-depth studies, a mathematics enthusiast, or simply curious to learn the secrets of cryptography, CryptoMatth is the ideal place to stimulate your curiosity and expand your skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy studying and happy browsing!
