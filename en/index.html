            <h2>What is CryptoMatth?</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>CryptoMatth</strong>, a space dedicated to exploring and studying mathematics and cryptography. Born from a passion for these two fascinating fields, this site aims to gather, deepen, and share knowledge acquired over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <em>Mathematics</em> section, you'll find a comprehensive course covering the topics taught in the final three years of high school, enriched with an in-depth study of Calculus 1. Each topic is presented with detailed explanations and accompanied by practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts and enhance critical thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Cryptography</em> section takes you through the history and evolution of ciphers, structured like a university-level course. Together, we'll explore encryption techniques, from classical methods to modern cryptographic systems, with clear examples and problem-solving exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're a student seeking deeper insights, a mathematics enthusiast, or simply curious about the secrets of cryptography, CryptoMatth is the perfect place to fuel your curiosity and expand your knowledge.
            </p>
